                MAC address, IP address and port addresses are used in link, network and transport layer respectively.

               The MAC address is the physical address of your device (such as network interface card). 
               It is fixed and each device in the world has a unique MAC address.
               This address is used to transmit your data between 2 nodes in the network.

               The IP address, unlike MAC address, can be changed. 
               For example, each time you access the network, your device will be assigned a new IP address by the server via DHCP (dynamic host configuration protocol).
               This address is used to route your data through the network from the source computing device to the desired destination.

               Finally, the port number is used to guide the data to the right process running on your computer. 
               For example, your computer is running 2 processes: 
               1 is email and the other is web browser and these 2 processes has two different port numbers. 
               When a data packet arrives at your computer, the port number is checked to forward this to the right process.
